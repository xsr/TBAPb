## TBAP#01 Address Bound Token

# Summary

The point is to develop and deploy custom NFT Collection for any soul-based logic to keep track it in any popular wallet and place link to control it in NFT Item Description.

The Apocryphal Proposal is to stop talking about "SOUL" and nane it more realistic: ADDRESS BOUND.

The Interface should be as simple as "throw exeception on calling `transfer`" â€” everything else is Developer's opinion.
